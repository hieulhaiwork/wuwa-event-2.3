This is a simple simulation of how the cube race event in wuwa version 2.3 works.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Necessary libraries:
```(python)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Adjust parameter NUM_ITER to determine the number of simulations you want to test.
- Change verbose = True if you want to see the process of the race.
- The return of simulation function also includes not only the highest-rank cube but also others. Feel free to modify the code to explore more.
